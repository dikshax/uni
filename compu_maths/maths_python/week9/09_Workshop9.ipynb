    "Cryptology is a science of making and analyzing ciphers.  In a simple case, if Alice and Bob want to send each other encrypted messages, all they have to do is agree on which encryption method they are going to use.  (“Alice” and “Bob” are often used in cryptology literature to explain secure communications between two people or organizations.  There is a third character, eavesdropper “Eve,” who monitors all exchanges between Alice and Bob.  Eve will try to guess which method Alice and Bob are using.)"

When Alice receives the lock, she puts her message in a box, puts the lock on it, clicks it locked, and sends the box to Bob."
