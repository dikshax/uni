    "A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.  For example: ‚ÄúHenry likes macaroni,‚Äù or ‚Äú100 is a prime.‚Äù  Formal logic deals with the laws of reasoning that apply to propositions.  Logical operations on propositions are not unlike arithmetic operations on numbers.  For example, take the distributive law for multiplication:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b><i>a(b + c) = ab + ac</i></b><br>Similarly, we can use the notation of Boolean algebra to express general laws of logic.  For example:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b><i>not(A and B) <=> (not A) or (not B)</i></b><br>\n",
