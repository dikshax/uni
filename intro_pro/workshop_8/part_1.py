# (a) What are the two kinds of entities “bundled” in a class?

# (b) Any number of what kind of entity that can be created from any given class?
'''You can create as many instances of a class as you like!''' 

# (c) What are the three fundamental features that an object-oriented programming language has in support of object-oriented programming?

'''
1. inheretance - a class inhereting from another all the methods and veriables so you dont have to rewrite it again and keep your code DRY.

2. incapsulation - something to do with keeping things private
3. polymorphism - 
'''

# (d) What else does encapsulation provide other than the ability to bundle together instance variable and methods?

'''
not sure
'''

# (e) Describe what it means for a member of a class to be defined private.

'''
can not be accessed outside of the parent class.
'''

# (f) Explain the purpose of getters and setters.

'''
getters are used to get a value or veriable from the class.
setters are used to set a veriable or values in a class.
'''

# (g) Explain what the special identifier self is for in Python.

'''
in Python class, the self premiter of any method in the class, refers to the instance of that class.!
'''

# (h) Explain the use of name mangling in Python.

'''
not sure
'''

# (i) Explain when special methods __str__ and __repr__ are used in Python.

'''
dunder str is used to print string representation that easy for human to read.
dunder repr is used to print a string represtation that is close to the actual code and easy for computers tp understand.
'''

# (j) Explain when a subclass can serve as a subtype of another type.

'''

'''
# (k) For a given object obj, show how in Python the type of the object may be determined from within a program or the Python shell.
'''
by printing the type of the obj.
print(type(obj))
'''
# (l) Explain the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.
'''

'''
# (m) Explain the advantages of using polymorphism in program design.
'''

'''
# (n) What is the meaning of “duck typing” in Python?
'''
In python you don't have to diclare any type for your veriable, Python is dynamically typed language.
Python knows to work out, if it walks like a duck and quaks like a duck, then p
Python knows its a duck.
It uses 'Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission' philosophy.
