The guest speaker, Henry Koiper, got intrested in technology at very young age. He used to take his electrical toise apart and and put them back togther. Thats how he become the man he is today. he works on the security section, part of the mainframe, coding in Java. He is also working on a open project called zigi.rocks. It's a git like programm, version control, to make git work on mainframe platform.
Henry's advice for students on confrence were to joing free online conference to learn new things about your topic of intrest. This will help to raise  the profile amongs the community. He also suggested that it is better to learn a little bit about alot of techologies than learning alot of things just on one thing!
In Henry's oppenion the upcoming important topics or skills in IT/programming community will be machine learning, artifitial intelligene, duckers, containers, and students with skills in these areas will be more soft after.

The other two guest speakers at  todays conference were Chloe and Lucas. They both are student from the university of Wolverhampton in their second year of study. They both are members of mainframe student society and also Z ambasseder. they have communicate effectively with each other and with ordeince from conference call. they worked together to deliver the presentation and answer all the questions from the ordeince. 
the technical skills gain from thsi conference call was to install Visual Stodio Code. How to install pluggins for VSC. This conference was very helpful on how to start with master the mainframe competition.
